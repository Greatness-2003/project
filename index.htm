			<h1>The Mobility of African Students to US Institutions</h1>
		</header>

		<div class="preamble" id="zen-preamble" role="article">
			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In the early weeks of January 2023, I was in a debate with my sister. She claimed that one of the many reasons why Nigeria was still a third-world and developing country was because the nation was constantly being brain-drained. That students who would otherwise have contributed to the progress of the country are continuously going to institutions outside the country to study and not coming back. Of course I, being a Nigerian student in a US institution, am naturally one of the culprits. </p>
			<p>Luckily for me, the EducationUSA (a program by the US with offices around the world that assist students through the US institutions’ admission process) had just posted the 2022 Open Doors Report. Part of the report included the top 10 countries sending students to the US. I was very happy to show this to my sister, because although Nigeria was on the top 10 list (the only African country on the list, in fact) as number 10, it only had a total of 14438 students from the 2021/22 academic year studying in the US. </p>
      		<p>Let's put this in context. Nigeria is a country of over 225 million people, meaning &lt; 0.0062 percent of Nigeria’s citizens are studying in US institutions. I added the totals from the 2014/15 to 2021/22 academic years and it was about 0.04 percent. This was an interesting discovery to me and I decided to expand this to other African countries. </p>
			<p>This good-natured though heated debate with my sister formed the basis for this project.</p>

			<h1>Project Topic and Data</h1>
			<p>I am analyzing the flow of international students from certain African countries to US colleges and universities. Initially, my intent was to choose 5 countries from West Africa, but that proved to be a very little dataset. Now, my project is tailored towards the top 5 most populous countries in each African region, giving a total of 25 countries. </p>
			<p>My project has 3 main goals: 1. To analyze the trend of international student enrollment from the source countries. 2. To analyze the impact of COVID-19 on international student mobility and identify any changes or disruptions in the enrollment of international students. And 3. To determine what student visas, institution types and levels of education are more popular among the selected countries.</p>
      		<p>I collected most of the institution-related data from the<a href="https://opendoorsdata.org/fact_sheets/student-mobility/">Open Doors website,</a>while the visa<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/Non-Immigrant-Statistics/NIVDetailTables/FYs97-21_NIVDetailTable.xlsx">data</a> in Excel format was from travel.state.gov. Most of the preprocessing simply involved downloading the data for each country and then combining them manually into 1 table.</p>

			<h1>Visualizations</h1>
			<p>I made a total of 6 visualizations of different types eg. maps, bar chart, treemap, etc all of which were made in Tableau and therefore have interactive features.</p>
			<h2>Nigeria Consistently Has More Students Studying In The US</h2>
			<p>Naturally, I started off my visualizations with a map of Africa showing the number of international students in the US from the chosen countries, from the 2014/15 - 2021/22 academic years. I used a color gradient with lighter signifying low values and darker representing higher values. </p>
			<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1683745151291' style='position: relative; width: 800px'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;Int_Totals&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Project_16830775715720&#47;Int_Totals' /><param name='tabs' value='yes' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;Int_Totals&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1683745151291');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='90%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
			<p>NB: Countries shown in gray are those that weren't considered in the project</p>
			<p>This map however didn’t show me much. With the exception of Nigeria, which has much higher numbers than the other countries, it was difficult to see differences in the map through the years. The colors barely changed from one year to the other, and I often had to make sure I wasn’t just looking at the same map. Most of the other countries had numbers in the hundreds for all the years, with a few having students in the low thousands studying in the US. </p>
			<p>As for covid’s effect on the flow of students, there was a slight decrease in the number of students. Nigeria, for example, reduced by almost a thousand students from 2020-2021, but bounced back by about 2000 students in 2022.			</p>

			<h2>F-1 Visas Are The Most Sought After Student Visa Type In Most Countries</h2>
			<p>Next diagram I created was of the visas dataset. I initially intended this visualization as a tooltip in the map above. But I found that the years didn’t match: the international students dataset used academic years, while the visa dataset used fiscal years.</p>
			<p>I visualized this data using a side-by-side bar chart of student visas (F1, J1, and M1) issued by the US to students from the chosen countries from 2014-2021. This chart can be filtered by year, country, and visa type. In order to prevent having the move from one year to the other, I placed all years together but of course that can be filtered.</p>
			<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1683745916566' style='position: relative; width: 800px'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Visas ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;Visas&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Project_16830775715720&#47;Visas' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;Visas&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1683745916566');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='90%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
			<p>As has been foreshadowed by the previous diagram, Nigeria had much higher values overall with the others having values in hundreds and a few in low thousands. For most countries, F1 visas were the most popular. However, I noticed that almost all southern countries e.g. South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia, generally had more J1 students than they had F1 students studying in the US. Why this is so, I can’t imagine. Of course, the visas issued fell overall during the covid years, especially in 2020.</p>

			<h2>There Are Barely Any Non-Degree Students (Understandably)</h2>
			<p>The next diagram is a bubble plot showing the distribution of students by academic level for the last 2 academic years. Size indicates the range of values for the number of students in a country/academic level combination: bigger bubbles represent more students, while the colors represent the 4 categories of academic levels.			</p>
			<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1684194146917' style='position: relative; width: 800px'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Acad Level - 2020&#47;21 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;AcadLevel&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Project_16830775715720&#47;AcadLevel' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;AcadLevel&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1684194146917');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='90%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
			<p>From the plot, it can be seen that Graduate and Undergraduate levels compete often for the top position in many countries and carry the bulk of the students. While there are very few OPT and non-degree students. 			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits" id="zen-benefits" role="article">
			<h2>Africans Love PHDs</h2>
			<p>Here we have the stacked bar chart showing the percentage of students by institution type in the last academic year 2021/22. This diagram is heavily skewed. It is obvious that a huge percentage of students from all countries attend doctoral universities. This is in  line with the academic level plot where graduate students were a large chunk. </p>
			<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1683746566230' style='position: relative; width: 800px'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Intitute type ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;Intitutetype&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Project_16830775715720&#47;Intitutetype' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;Intitutetype&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1683746566230');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='90%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
			<p>What was more surprising than this however, is the fact that for most countries there is a much higher percentage of students getting an associate’s degree than a Bachelor’s in US institutions. As can be expected, special focus institutions had very little share of the students, with the highest being 3.2% from Lesotho.			</p>

			<h2>Coming Back To Nigeria (But Not Literally)</h2>
			<p>As has been seen repeatedly so far, Nigeria has proved to be the most interesting country of all. It consistently has ridiculously higher values throughout whether in visas, academic levels, etc. Because of this (and also possibly because of personal bias), I decided to explore it more and checked out other variables. I created a tree diagram showing the number of students from Nigeria in different fields of study from 2014-2022.			</p>
			<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1683750279483' style='position: relative; width: 800px'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Study - 2014&#47;15 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;Study&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Project_16830775715720&#47;Study' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;Project_16830775715720&#47;Study&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1683750279483');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='90%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
			<p>For a while, Engineering, Business/Mgmt, Health and Physical sciences were the top 4 most studied fields and carried the bulk of students. After a while however, fields like Math/Computer science, Social sciences, etc started getting more popular with an increasing number of students and Math/Computer science overthrowing Business/Mgmt to enter the top 4. However Engineering stayed constantly as number 1 throughout.			</p>

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, the analysis of international student enrollment from selected African countries in US colleges and universities reveals several key findings.			</p>
			<p>Firstly, Nigeria consistently stands out as the country with the highest number of students studying in the US. While the overall flow of international students from other African countries is relatively low, Nigeria showcases a significant presence. However, it's important to note that the percentage of Nigerian students studying in the US remains relatively small when considering the country's population size.			</p>
			<p>Secondly, the impact of COVID-19 on international student mobility is evident. There was a slight decrease in the number of students overall, but most countries bounced back with increased enrollment in 2022. This highlights the resilience of African students in pursuing their education abroad despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.			</p>
			<p>Furthermore, F-1 visas emerged as the most popular student visas across most countries. While Nigeria had higher values overall, several southern African countries had more J-1 students than F-1 students in the US. The reasons behind this discrepancy would require further investigation.			</p>
			<p>Regarding academic levels, graduate and undergraduate students constituted the majority of the international student population, with very few opting for non-degree programs. It's interesting to note that a significant percentage of students from the selected countries pursued doctoral programs in US institutions.			</p>
			<p>The field of study preferences among Nigerian students showcased an evolving trend, with engineering consistently dominating as the most popular choice. However, fields like math/computer science and social sciences gained popularity over time, reflecting shifting interests and opportunities for Nigerian students pursuing education in the US.			</p>
			<p>Overall, this project sheds light on the trends and dynamics of international student enrollment from selected African countries in US colleges and universities. 			</p>
